The [Tic Tac Toe React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from React.org. I extracted the components and helper module into their own files.

I had to research how to import/export a helper module, and for that I used `named export`: [Using named exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export#Using_named_exports) 

Compare to the [TicTacToe CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR) by redux creator, Dan Abramov.
